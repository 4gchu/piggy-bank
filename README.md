# piggy-bank

This program is a virtual piggy bank which can be downloaded and accessed from any system using local host; it was created with the intention of promoting financial literacy among elementary school students by introducing them to the concept of keeping track of one's money using a virtual piggy bank.

Financial literacy, especially in young children, is a concept not frequently taught but an extremely important skill for the future. By teaching children the value of money and how to budget their finances from a young age, this not only teaches them valuable knowledge they can carry for the rest of their lives but also spurs interest in the field of finance. 

Enjoy!
